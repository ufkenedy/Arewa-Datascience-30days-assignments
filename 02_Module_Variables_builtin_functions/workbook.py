### Exercises: Level 1


# Day 2: 30 Days of python programming

# Declare variables and assign values

first_name = "John"
last_name = "Doe"
full_name = first_name + " " + last_name
country = "USA"
city = "New York"
age = 25
year = 2024
is_married = False
is_true = True
is_light_on = True

# Declare multiple variables on one line
x, y, z = 1, 2, 3

### Exercises: Level 2


# Check data types
print(type(first_name))

print(type(last_name))
print(type(full_name))
print(type(country))
print(type(city))
print(type(age))
print(type(year))
print(type(is_married))
print(type(is_true))
print(type(is_light_on))

# Find the length of the first name
print(len(first_name))

# Compare the length of first name and last name
print(len(first_name) == len(last_name))

# Arithmetic operations
num_one = 5
num_two = 4

total = num_one + num_two
diff = num_one - num_two
product = num_one * num_two
division = num_one / num_two
remainder = num_one % num_two
exp = num_one ** num_two
floor_division = num_one // num_two

print(total, diff, product, division, remainder, exp, floor_division)

# Circle calculations
radius = 30
pi = 3.14159
area_of_circle = pi * radius ** 2
circum_of_circle = 2 * pi * radius

print(area_of_circle, circum_of_circle)

# Take radius as user input and calculate the area
user_radius = float(input("Enter the radius of the circle: "))
user_area_of_circle = pi * user_radius ** 2
print(user_area_of_circle)

# Get user input for personal information
user_first_name = input("Enter your first name: ")
user_last_name = input("Enter your last name: ")
user_country = input("Enter your country: ")
user_age = input("Enter your age: ")

print(user_first_name, user_last_name, user_country, user_age)

# Check for Python reserved words
help('keywords')
